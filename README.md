# CHEM2011-Lab-Report

This is the Github Repo for my CHEM2011 2022 Lab Report.

You can compile the $\LaTeX$ source file if you want, you need to use XeLaTeX (I think). I wouldn't recommend it, just look at the PDF.

Note that EPS files have been used for integration with Adobe Illustrator. When you compile the document it will convert them all to PDFs. This will take quite a while when you do it first.
