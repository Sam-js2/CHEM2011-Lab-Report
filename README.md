# CHEM2011-Lab-Report

This is the Github Repo for my CHEM2011 2022 Lab Report.

You can compile the $\LaTeX$ source file if you want, you need to use XeLaTeX (I think). I wouldn't recommend it, just look at the PDF. Make sure to compile it twice so your compiler can generate the required aux files to do references, conversions exe.

Note that EPS files have been used for integration with Adobe Illustrator. When you compile the document it will convert them all to PDFs. This will take quite a while when the first time you do it but providing you keep them it should be instant from then on.

Also note that the word doc just contains all the text of the $\LaTeX$ file, it was just used to find wordcount, do some spellcheck and edit the text on the go (iPad). The .tex file should be regarded as authoratative.
